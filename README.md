 Hi! I'm called Renan Pinho and I'm currently a computer science student at Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPel).

"So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not concern either the living or the deadhm since for the former it is not, and for the latter are no more." - Epicurus
